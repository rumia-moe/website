[title]:- "Website Devlog #1"
[date]:- "2026-02-07"

I've started work on my new website. There's still a lot of functionality left for me to implement so I'll keep today's post short. It's good to see this blog working within a day of starting this project! 

I am also still new to using the Markdown format, so I'm sure it will take a while until I can create these posts quickly whilst also making them enjoyable to read.
